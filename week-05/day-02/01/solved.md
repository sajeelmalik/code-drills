## Bridge Problem

*Since we have two members who cross the bridge at 5 and 10 minutes each, it would be optimal to have them cross together. Ideally, we would want a fast runner already on the other side of the bridge if we follow this strategy. So we will start with Jerome and Ricky crossing the bridge, and then have Jerome bring the flashlight back for Robert and Sasha.*

### Solution

First, Jerome and Ricky cross the bridge. (2 min)

Then, Jerome carries the flashlight back (+1 min = 3 min)

Robert and Sasha cross the bridge together (+10 min = 13 min)

Finally, Ricky runs the flashlight back to Jerome, and they both come back together (+ 2 min + 2 min = **17 min**)

### Interestingly, I remember solving this problem for a quest in RuneScape when I was 12
