[The Ethics of Coding](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/the-ethics-of-coding)
>Bill Sourour was twenty-one when he was asked to build a website for a pharmaceutical company. It was a quiz that asked users to select symptoms so that it could recommend a drug as a possible solution. But for almost every option the user selected, the quiz would recommend the same drug. It didnâ€™t feel right, but when Bill later heard that a side effect of the drug was depression and a young woman who had taken that drug had committed suicide, it felt very, very wrong. Bill tells us the story of his first code-related ethical conflict, his thoughts on the role of ethics in coding, and how the incident affects how he approaches code today.

[What happens in a technical interview?](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/what-happens-in-a-technical-interview)
>Whether you're a new developer or an experienced developer, you probably don't enjoy the technical interview process. It's long, hard, and, often times, not even related to the actual job you're interviewing for. So how do you make the most of this notoriously difficult process? We talk to Parker Phinney, creator of Interview Cake, on what to expect in an interview and what to do when you feel like you don't know what you're doing.

[How to teach yourself computer science](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/how-to-teach-yourself-computer-science)

>Vaidehi decided to take on a year-long challenge. She'd pick a computer science topic every week, do tons of research and write a technical blog post explaining it in simple terms and beautiful illustrations. And then she actually did it. She tells us about her project, basecs, how it's changed her as a developer, and how she handles the trolls and negativity from people who don't appreciate her work.

##### Podcast:

[S1:E1 "Bits, Binary, and Bytes"](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs)
>Binary is the foundation of computer science. We give you a beginner-friendly breakdown of how to count in binary (with some fun counting challenges you can join in on!), how it relates to bits and bytes, and why it's important for us to know as developers. Based on Vaidehi Joshi's first blog post, ["Bits, Bytes, Building with Binary."]((https://medium.com/basecs/bits-bytes-building-with-binary-13cb4289aafa))


[S1:E2 "What is encoding?"](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs)

>Binary is great for computers, but really tough for humans to work with. We need something that's a bit easier for us. That's where encoding comes in. Vaidehi and Saron explore how encoding works and talk through some popular encoding schemes like ASCII, unicode, and base64. Based on Vaidehi Joshi's second blog post, ["Hexes and Other Magical Numbers"]((https://medium.com/basecs/hexs-and-other-magical-numbers-9785bc26b7ee)). Check out the [ASCII table  here](http://www.infocellar.com/binary/ascii-ebcdic.htm).


##### Topics:

* Binary Search
* Efficiency
* Time Complexity
* Time Complexity of built in methods



##### Exercises:

1. [Binary Search](day-05/01)

2. [Efficiency 1 - Give the time complexity](day-05/02)

3. [Efficiency 2 - Coefficients and Lower Order Terms](day-05/03)

4. [Efficiency 3 - Hidden Costs of Methods](day-05/04)

5. [Efficiency 4 - repeated elements](day-05/05)




##### Podcast:

[S1:E3 "Hex Queen"](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs)
>Let's explore a very special number together: 16. It's the core of the hexadecimal system, and, in this episode, we'll learn how to count in hexes, discuss where we might see the hexadecimal system in real life, and breakdown the math that makes number 16 so special. Based on Vaidehi Joshi's second blog post, ["Hexes and Other Magical Numbers"](https://medium.com/basecs/hexs-and-other-magical-numbers-9785bc26b7ee). 

[S1:E4 "Hexes and Colors"](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs)
>If you've worked with CSS, you've probably seen colors represented as hex values. But how on earth does #EC152E give us the color red? With a little help of math, we show you how to represent millions of colors in hex values and how those correlate to RGB values. We also dig into the color theory behind those values. Based on Vaidehi Joshi's second blog post, ["Hexes and Other Magical Numbers"](https://medium.com/basecs/hexs-and-other-magical-numbers-9785bc26b7ee).
