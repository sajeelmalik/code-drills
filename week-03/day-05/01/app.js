       a. create a varialbe named `cors` that has the value `https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/`
        
        Because our request to this server is coming from a different app, there is a risk of running into a `cross-origin` error. Prepending the above url to our query url will handle this error for us.

			  b.	create a variable named `baseURL` with the value `https://funwithajax.herokuapp.com/api`

				c.  create a variable with the name `query` with the value `"?q=heroes"`
					(parameter `q` with the value `heroes`.) 

					Example: to pass the parameter `q` with a value of `chicken` we can use `?q=chicken`
					use `?`` to denote query parameter are being used
					`q` for query 
					followed by the parameter value
			*/

      /* 
      3.
				Using ajax make a `GET` request to:
          `cors` plus `baseURL` plus `query`
          Close your promise (.then()) just before you close the function. We will be writing the rest of our code within the promise, ensuring that all this logic happens only once we've received a return from the API.
